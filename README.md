## Source data
We use Kaggle dataset called Customer Suport on Twitter for this workshop, you'll find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter.

To run the preprocessing part of our notebook, unzip the data and copy it to the data/raw_data folder.


## Environment setting

1. Create a virtual environment
   - To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
        ```
        python -m venv myenv
        ```
   - This command creates a new virtual environment named `myenv` in the current directory.

2. Activate the virtual environment
    - To activate the virtual environment, run the appropriate command based on your operating system:
      - For Windows:
        ```
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      - For macOS/Linux:
        ```
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install dependencies
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
     This command installs all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. Deactivate the virtual environment
   - To deactivate the virtual environment run the following command:
     ```
     deactivate
     ```
